          p.lead Kate Dyer needs your help to win this election. Vote, volunteer, and donate.
          p.
            Being qualified isn't the only thing that wins elections! While
            Kate is the best person for the job, she still needs every bit
            of help she can get in pursuit of getting the word out.

          p.
            Every dollar you give out of support for Kate brings her one step
            closer to winning that seat.

          p.
            If you donate, here's what we'll do with the money:

          ul
            li Buy road signs, large and small
            li Purchase advertising

          img.img-responsive.center-block(src="http://placehold.it/500x500&text=Kate's Thanks Pic")

          p.
            We want to tell you that everything makes a difference, from a handshake to a dollar
            to an hour spent helping Kate's campaign, but, most of all, we want to say

          p.h1.text-center Thank You!

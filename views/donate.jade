          p.lead Kate Dyer needs your help to win this election. Volunteer, donate, and VOTE.
          p.lead.
            Being qualified isn't the only thing that wins elections! While
            Kate is the best person for the job, she still needs every bit
            of help she can get in pursuit of getting the word out.

          p.
            With more than X years of experience as a prosecutor and attorney,
            including X years as a judge already effectively serving her
            community in X and Y counties, Kate Dyer is, without question or
            competition, the most qualified, experienced, and dedicated person
            for the job.

          p.
            But simply being the most qualified isnâ€™t always
            enough. Before Kate can help you, she needs your help to win this
            election.

          p.
            Every dollar donated will go to the effort to educate
            and inform the voters of X and Y counties as to the importance of
            bringing the most experienced candidate to the bench this August.
            That means buying more road signs, more newspaper and print
            advertisements, more campaign materials, and more educational
            materials.
          p.
            Kate has big plans to improve judicial efficiency and
            accountability. Will you help today with a donation to help make
            that happen in your community? If you care about a fair, honest,
            and efficient court, you should care about her candidacy.

            will be more efficient, more effective, and more accountable -when
